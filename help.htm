<h1 id=str1>NVIS Help</h1>
<h1><a href="index.html">Back to main page</a></h1>

<p>Line of Sight (LOS) mode is range limited by terrain.</p>
<p>Most often only 5-10 km or so.</p>
<p>NVIS covers from 0 to 700 km distance, 24x7.</p>
<p>NVIS uses reflection from ever changing Ionosphere.</p>
<p>As propagations change, optimal frequency will change.</p>
<p>NVIS needs 3 frequencies: day, night  and noon/extended.</p>
<p>NVIS is effective from almost any site.</p>
<p>SkyWave covers much longer distances than NVIS.</p>
<p>Most antenna sites are not very good for SkyWave.</p>
<p>Obstacles and terrain often block low elevation angles.</p>
<h2>Controls Explained</h2>
<p>State – Australian state, latitude.</p>
<p>Month –season of the year.</p>
<p>Year –sunspot cycle progression</p>
<p>Help – gets you some help</p>
<p>Mast –antenna height</p>
<p>Antenna – antenna type (Rx & Tx)</p>
<p>Power – transmit power</p>
<p>ELmin – minimum elevation angle for antenna site</p>
<p>Distance – distance between stations</p>
<p>Location – rural, suburban, city</p>
<p>Weather – storms affect NVIS</p>
<h2>Results Explained</h2>
<p>foF2= three critical frequencies</p>
<p>MUF= three optimal frequencies to use</p>
<p>SSN= smoothed sunspot number (solar cycle)</p>
<p>f = frequency</p>
<p>Eirp = efective isotropic radiated power</p>
<p>Li = isotropic Free Space Path Loss</p>
<p>Ld = attenuation in D region (DRAP)</p>
<p>Lt = Li+Ld, total isotropic path loss in dB</p>
<p>N = noise level in dBm (ITU recommendation)</p>
<p>SNR = signal to noise ratio, higher is better</p>
<p>SnrD = SNR during day</p>
<p>SnrN= SNR during night</p>
<p>Red fonts= frequency too high (no reflection)</p>
<p>Minimum useful SNR is 5 dB for data, and 10 dB for voice.</p>
