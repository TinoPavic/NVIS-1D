<h1 id=str1>NVIS Help</h1>
<h1><a href="index.html">Back to main page</a></h1>
<p>Line of Sight (LOS) range is limited by terrain to 2-10km.</p>
<p>Ground Wave (GW) range is limited by terrain and ground to 10-60km.</p>
<p>SkyWave uses reflection from ionosphere and cover entire Earth.</p>
<p>NVIS covers from 0 to 600 km distance regardless of terrain, location, season and time of day.</p>
<p>Ionosphere changes all the time, and optimal frequencies change with it.</p>
<p>NVIS needs 2 frequencies: day and night. Extended range NVIS needs 1 more for noon/extended .</p>
<p>NVIS is effective from almost any antenna site.</p>
<p>SkyWave covers much longer distances than NVIS, but most antenna sites are not suitable.</p>
<p>Obstacles and terrain often block low elevation angles used for Skywave.</p>
<h2>Link setup (row 1)</h2>
<p>View Select -options are: table, SNR plot, Skip plot, SLM plot or help</p>
<p>State – Australian state, latitude.</p>
<p>Month –season of the year.</p>
<p>Year –sunspot cycle progression</p>
<p>hF2 - layer F2 height above ground</p>
<p>Dist –terrestrial link distance</p>
<h2>Transmiter setup (row 2)</h2>
<p>Tx Ant – select transmit antenna type</p>
<p>Mast –transmit antenna height</p>
<p>Power – transmit power</p>
<p>EL – minimum elevation angle for antenna site</p>
<p>Grx – receive antenna gain use (off, on, avg)</p>
<h2>Receiver setup (row 3)</h2>
<p>Rx Ant – select receive antenna type</p>
<p>Mast –transmit antenna height</p>
<p>Location – rural, suburban, city</p>
<p>Weather – storms affect NVIS</p>
<h2>Results in rows 3 and 4 explained</h2>
<p>foF2= F2 layer critical frequencies for: night, day and midday.</p>
<p>SSN= smoothed sunspot number (solar cycle)</p>
<p>SLM= Secant law frequency multiplier</p>
<p>FOT= Frequencies of optimal transmission for: night, day and midday</p>
<p>Hops= number of ionospheric hops in link</p>
<p>El= elevation of wave vector, 0 degrees is towards horizon</p>
<p>B= wave angle of incidence into F2 layer</p>
<h2>Results in table explained</h2>
<p>f = frequency in MHz</p>
<p>Eirp = efective isotropic radiated power in dBm</p>
<p>FSPL = Free Space Path Loss in dB</p>
<p>Drap = attenuation in D region dB</p>
<p>Lt = Fspl+Drap, total path loss in dB</p>
<p>N = noise level in dBm (ITU recommendation)</p>
<p>SNR = signal to noise ratio in dB, higher is better</p>
<p>SnrM = SNR during mid-day in dB</p>
<p>SnrD = SNR during day in dB</p>
<p>SnrN= SNR during night in dB</p>
<p>Red fonts= frequency too high (no reflection)</p>
<p>Minimum useful SNR is 5 dB for data, and 10 dB for voice.</p>
